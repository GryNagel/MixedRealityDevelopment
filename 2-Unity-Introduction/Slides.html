        # What is Unity?
        - Real-time engine
        - Supports a large number of platforms
        - Advanced editing tool
        - Can be used for 2D and 3D applications from small games, to enterprise solutions
        - Designer around a component model
        - Has it's own asset store

        ]

        - Every object in your game is a GameObject (E.g. Camera, 3D-models, light).
        - By giving GameObjects a component you can add properties to it. 
        - Unity has predefined components, but you can also create your own components by writing scripts

        ]

        .active[
          ## Prefabs
        ]

        - Prefabs is a collection of one or more GameObjects that you can create configure and store
        - The GameObjects will keep their properties
        - Makes GameObjects reusable, if you update the prefab all usage of the prefab will be updated

        .active[
          ## Colliders
        ]

        - Defines the shape of an object to be used for physical collisions
        - Invisible, and can have simpler mesh than the object its on
        - We need to use colliders to be able to interact with 3D models

        - A level in gaming terms
        - Contains the environment and menus of your game
        - Split up an application in different pieces

        - Mix of assets and Prefabs
        - **Parenting:** When creating a group of objects, the topmost object is referred to as the parent. All objects underneath are children.
        - Children inherit the position, scale and rotation
