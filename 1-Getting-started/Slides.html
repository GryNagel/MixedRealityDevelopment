        Device Abstraction Layer
        Bridge between external SDK’s and the MRTK to conform output/input. Work for different devices. 
        
        MRTK Constructs
        Defines interactions with multiple VR/AR platforms. 
        
        MRTK Interface Layer
        A bridge to coordinate inputs coming from VR devices and controllers. 
        
        MRTK User Abstraction layer
        The SDK front end. Includes pre-build components. Easy to use components/scripts. 
        
        “Out of the box”
        Everything should have tests
        Programamatic inferface
        Documentation
        Standarlized examples
        
        The new framework needs to provide “out of the box” components to enable rapid prototyping and development. Future internal changes should not break these components or cause them to degrade in functionality.
        Every component / feature provided by the framework (either prefab or script) should have corresponding unit tests to validate its functionality. Any future merge to the framework will have to validate these test before merging to ensure there is no degradation of service.
        The new framework should provide a programmatic interface along side the SDK components, to enable advanced users to extend or replace any component within the framework.
        Each new interface / component should be fully documented (where possible). These should detail all interactions and intended uses. For the advanced cases, we’ll need to review how we explain how to replace components (e.g. replacing the input system with another, like InControl)
        Working examples / demos should be created for any specific system, these should have purpose and not just be a “test”.
        All testing components / scripts / prefabs / scenes should only be retained in the dev branch. The master branch should only contain the “ToolKit” and working examples. Master is for consumers only.
        Simulator options need to be provided as another device. This will also form the template for new MR/XR/VR devices / SDKs.
