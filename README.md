## üìù Software requirements
- Windows 10 (developer mode [enabled](https://www.ghacks.net/2015/06/13/how-to-enable-developer-mode-in-windows-10-to-sideload-apps/))

- We need the newest version of the Windows 10 SDK and currently that is not the one that gets installed from Visual Studio, so we need to download that manually: [Windows 10 SDK (10.0.18362.0)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
- [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) (Version 2018.3.x recommended)
